## Simple MLP model implemented in Apple's MLX framework.

This is largely modeled after Karpathy's makemore model. Specifically, the MLP version implemented here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCH_1BHY58I

I've eliminated all uses of PyTorch and ported the model to MLX.

The notebook serves as a breakdown of the functions/steps, and the Python file simply completes all steps (e.g. embedding, training, evaluating, and sampling) and prints the results.

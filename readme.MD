## Simple MLP model implemented in Apple's MLX framework.

This is largely modeled after Karpathy's makemore model. Specifically, the MLP version implemented here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCH_1BHY58I

I've eliminated all uses of PyTorch and ported the model to MLX.

I am still working on the Python file, so I'd recommend viewing/running the notebook to experiment with the model.
